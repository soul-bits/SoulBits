## Understanding Visual Formatting and ATS

### Why Visual Formatting Matters

1. **ATS Scanners**: Applicant Tracking Systems must be able to read your resume. Complex formatting, text boxes, and graphics can break ATS scanners, causing your resume to be rejected before a human sees it.

2. **Hiring Managers**: Hiring managers spend only 5-10 seconds initially reviewing resumes. Visual formatting helps grab their attention and makes your resume easy to scan.

3. **Professionalism**: A well-formatted resume shows you put effort into important tasks, which is how employers expect you to perform on the job.

### The Balance

Your resume needs to be:
- **Eye-catching**: Professional and visually appealing
- **ATS-friendly**: Readable by automated scanners
- **Simple**: Not overly complicated or flashy

**The Sweet Spot**: Professional, eye-catching, and ATS-optimized templates have the best conversion rate.

## Template Selection

### DO: Use Professional Templates

**What Makes a Good Template**:
- Professional and eye-catching
- ATS-friendly (readable by scanners)
- Balanced design (not too simple, not too complex)
- Modern look but easy to follow
- Follows traditional resume layouts

**Best Templates**:
- Professional, eye-catching, and ATS-optimized
- These have the best conversion rate
- Balance visual appeal with functionality

### DON'T: Use Problematic Templates

**Avoid These**:
- **Overly complicated templates**: Won't pass ATS scanners
- **Too simple templates**: Employers think you don't put effort in
- **Canva's overly designed templates**: Not ATS-friendly and not professional
- **Flashy and cool-looking templates**: Often not ATS-friendly
- **Templates with too many graphics**: Affects readability and professionalism

**What to Tell Them**:
"Choose a template that balances eye-catching design with simplicity. Professional, ATS-optimized templates have the best conversion rate. Avoid overly complicated designs that won't pass ATS scanners, but also avoid templates that are too simple—employers want to see you put effort into important tasks."

## Layout Requirements

### Best Layout: Traditional One-Column

**Why One-Column Works Best**:
- Easiest for ATS scanners to read
- Most professional appearance
- Follows traditional resume format
- Clear, easy-to-follow structure

### Two-Column Layout: NOT Recommended

**Critical**: Two-column formats (where one side is shaded and the other is not) **do not work with many ATS systems in the US**.

**What to Do**:
- **Keep it simple: one column resume only**
- If it feels too boring, use colored fonts or shading throughout, but stick to one column
- One-column format is the safest option for ATS compatibility

**Why Two-Column Doesn't Work**:
- Many ATS systems in the US cannot properly parse two-column layouts
- Even if made with Word's columns feature, many systems struggle with this format
- The risk of ATS parsing errors is too high

**What to Tell Them**:
"Two-column formats don't work with many ATS systems in the US. Keep it simple with a one-column layout. If you want to add visual interest, use colored fonts or shading throughout, but maintain a single-column structure. This ensures your resume is readable by both ATS systems and humans."

### What to Check

**DO**:
- Use traditional one-column layout (safest option)
- Use colored fonts or shading for visual interest if needed, but maintain one column

**DON'T**:
- Use two-column formats (they don't work with many ATS systems in the US)
- Use text boxes for layout
- Use complex multi-column designs with text boxes
- Create layouts that confuse ATS scanners

## Colors & Fonts

### Colors

**DO**:
- Use simple colors—black and white is great
- Add small amounts of gray, blue, or pink as accent colors
- Blue tends to work extremely well as an accent color in resumes
- Keep colors professional and minimal

**DON'T**:
- Overdo colors
- Use bright, distracting colors
- Use too many different colors
- Make colors interfere with readability

**What to Check**:
- Are colors simple and professional?
- Is there too much color?
- Do colors enhance or distract from the content?
- Is text readable against colored backgrounds?

**What to Tell Them**:
"Keep colors simple and professional. Black and white is perfect, with small amounts of gray, blue, or pink as accents. Blue works especially well as an accent color. Avoid overdoing colors—too much color can look unprofessional and distract from your content."

### Fonts

**DO**:
- Use 1-2 simple fonts maximum (one is also fine)
- Choose professional, easy-to-read fonts
- Keep font choices consistent throughout

**DON'T**:
- Use more than 2 fonts
- Use decorative or hard-to-read fonts
- Mix too many font styles

**What to Check**:
- Are fonts simple and professional?
- Are there more than 2 fonts?
- Is text easy to read?
- Are fonts consistent throughout?

**What to Tell Them**:
"Use 1-2 simple, professional fonts maximum. Choose fonts that are easy to read and look professional. Consistency is key—use the same fonts throughout your resume for a polished appearance."

## Text Boxes and Graphics

### Text Boxes: NEVER Use Them

**Why Text Boxes Are Problematic**:
- Content made in text boxes can alter the order ATS scanners read information
- ATS scanners may skip content in text boxes
- Text boxes break ATS compatibility
- They make resumes look less professional

**What to Check**:
- Are there any text boxes in the resume?
- Is content created using text boxes?
- Is the layout built with text boxes?

**What to Tell Them**:
"Never use text boxes in your resume. Text boxes alter the order ATS scanners read information and can cause your resume to be rejected. Use standard formatting and Word's columns feature if you need multiple columns."

### Graphics and Images

**DO**:
- Keep graphics minimal and professional
- Use simple visual elements that enhance readability
- Use visual hierarchy to guide the reader's eye

**DON'T**:
- Include photos or pictures of yourself
- Use strange graphics or complex images
- Add graphics that affect readability
- Include graphics that make the resume look unprofessional

**Why Graphics Can Be Problematic**:
- Affects ATS readability
- Makes resume look less professional (most of the time)
- Can distract from content
- Photos can lead to discrimination

**What to Check**:
- Are there photos or pictures?
- Are there strange graphics?
- Do graphics enhance or distract?
- Are graphics professional?

**What to Tell Them**:
"Avoid photos, pictures, and strange graphics in your resume. These can affect ATS readability and make your resume look less professional. Focus on clean, simple formatting that enhances readability and looks professional."

## Visual Enhancements That Work

### Bold the Most Impressive Parts

**What to Do**:
- Take the most impressive part of your most impressive bullet points
- Put those parts in bold
- Make accomplishments jump off the page

**Why This Works**:
- Hiring managers read these bolded parts first
- They get impressed immediately
- Then they read the rest with a "high performer" lens
- This is powerful psychology

**Example**:
- Regular: "Streamlined supply chain operations by implementing automated inventory management system across 12 warehouse locations, reducing inventory costs by 23% and improving delivery times by 15%"
- With Bold: "Streamlined supply chain operations by implementing automated inventory management system across **12 warehouse locations**, reducing inventory costs by **23%** and improving delivery times by **15%**"

**What to Check**:
- Are impressive parts of bullet points bolded?
- Are key numbers and accomplishments highlighted?
- Does bolding guide the reader's eye to important information?

**What to Tell Them**:
"Bold the most impressive parts of your bullet points—especially numbers, percentages, and key accomplishments. This makes your achievements jump off the page and helps hiring managers see your value immediately. They'll read the bolded parts first, get impressed, then read the rest with a positive lens."

### Visual Hierarchy

**What to Do**:
- Use visual hierarchy to guide the reader's eye
- Make key sections stand out
- Use formatting to emphasize important information

**Elements of Visual Hierarchy**:
- Bold job titles
- Clear section headings
- Consistent spacing
- Proper alignment

**What to Check**:
- Is there clear visual hierarchy?
- Do key sections stand out?
- Is important information emphasized?
- Is formatting consistent?

**What to Tell Them**:
"Use visual hierarchy to guide the reader's eye. Bold job titles, use clear section headings, maintain consistent spacing, and ensure proper alignment. This makes your resume easy to scan and helps hiring managers find the information they need quickly."
