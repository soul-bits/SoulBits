# Visual Resume Formatting Guide

## Why Visual Formatting Matters

### For ATS Scanners
Applicant Tracking Systems must be able to read your resume. Complex formatting, text boxes, and graphics can break ATS scanners, causing your resume to be rejected before a human sees it.

### For Hiring Managers
Hiring managers spend only 5-10 seconds initially reviewing resumes. Visual formatting helps grab their attention and makes your resume easy to scan. A well-formatted resume creates a positive first impression, shows professionalism, and makes hiring managers want to read more.

### The Balance
Your resume needs to be:
- **Eye-catching**: Professional and visually appealing
- **ATS-friendly**: Readable by automated scanners
- **Simple**: Not overly complicated or flashy

**The Sweet Spot**: Professional, eye-catching, and ATS-optimized templates have the best conversion rate.

## Core Requirements

### Template Selection

**Use Professional Templates**
- Professional and eye-catching
- ATS-friendly (readable by scanners)
- Balanced design (not too simple, not too complex)
- Modern look but easy to follow
- Follows traditional resume layouts

**Avoid Problematic Templates**
- Overly complicated templates (won't pass ATS scanners)
- Too simple templates (employers think you don't put effort in)
- Canva's overly designed templates (not ATS-friendly and not professional)
- Flashy and cool-looking templates (often not ATS-friendly)
- Templates with too many graphics (affects readability and professionalism)

Choose a template that balances eye-catching design with simplicity. Professional, ATS-optimized templates have the best conversion rate. Avoid overly complicated designs that won't pass ATS scanners, but also avoid templates that are too simple—employers want to see you put effort into important tasks.

### Layout

**Best Layout: Traditional One-Column**
- Easiest for ATS scanners to read
- Most professional appearance
- Follows traditional resume format
- Clear, easy-to-follow structure

**Two-Column Layout: NOT Recommended**
- **Critical**: Two-column formats (where one side is shaded and the other is not) **do not work with many ATS systems in the US**.
- Many ATS systems in the US cannot properly parse two-column layouts
- Even if made with Word's columns feature, many systems struggle with this format
- The risk of ATS parsing errors is too high

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Traditional one-column layout (safest option)
- [ ] No text boxes used for layout
- [ ] No complex multi-column designs with text boxes

Two-column formats don't work with many ATS systems in the US. Keep it simple with a one-column layout. If you want to add visual interest, use colored fonts or shading throughout, but maintain a single-column structure. This ensures your resume is readable by both ATS systems and humans.

### Colors

**DO**:
- Use simple colors—black and white is great
- Add small amounts of gray, blue, or pink as accent colors
- Blue tends to work extremely well as an accent color in resumes
- Keep colors professional and minimal

**DON'T**:
- Overdo colors
- Use bright, distracting colors
- Use too many different colors
- Make colors interfere with readability

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Colors are simple and professional
- [ ] Not too much color
- [ ] Colors enhance rather than distract from content
- [ ] Text is readable against colored backgrounds

Keep colors simple and professional. Black and white is perfect, with small amounts of gray, blue, or pink as accents. Blue works especially well as an accent color. Avoid overdoing colors—too much color can look unprofessional and distract from your content.

### Fonts

**DO**:
- Use 1-2 simple fonts maximum (one is also fine)
- Choose professional, easy-to-read fonts
- Keep font choices consistent throughout

**DON'T**:
- Use more than 2 fonts
- Use decorative or hard-to-read fonts
- Mix too many font styles

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Fonts are simple and professional
- [ ] No more than 2 fonts used
- [ ] Text is easy to read
- [ ] Fonts are consistent throughout

Use 1-2 simple, professional fonts maximum. Choose fonts that are easy to read and look professional. Consistency is key—use the same fonts throughout your resume for a polished appearance.

## What to Avoid

### Text Boxes: NEVER Use Them

**Why Text Boxes Are Problematic**:
- Content made in text boxes can alter the order ATS scanners read information
- ATS scanners may skip content in text boxes
- Text boxes break ATS compatibility
- They make resumes look less professional

**Checklist**:
- [ ] No text boxes in the resume
- [ ] Content is not created using text boxes
- [ ] Layout is not built with text boxes

Never use text boxes in your resume. Text boxes alter the order ATS scanners read information and can cause your resume to be rejected. Use standard formatting and Word's columns feature if you need multiple columns.

### Graphics and Images

**DO**:
- Keep graphics minimal and professional
- Use simple visual elements that enhance readability
- Use visual hierarchy to guide the reader's eye

**DON'T**:
- Include photos or pictures of yourself
- Use strange graphics or complex images
- Add graphics that affect readability
- Include graphics that make the resume look unprofessional

**Why Graphics Can Be Problematic**:
- Affects ATS readability
- Makes resume look less professional (most of the time)
- Can distract from content
- Photos can lead to discrimination

**Checklist**:
- [ ] No photos or pictures
- [ ] No strange graphics
- [ ] Graphics enhance rather than distract
- [ ] Graphics are professional

Avoid photos, pictures, and strange graphics in your resume. These can affect ATS readability and make your resume look less professional. Focus on clean, simple formatting that enhances readability and looks professional.

## Visual Enhancements That Work

### Bold the Most Impressive Parts

**What to Do**:
- Take the most impressive part of your most impressive bullet points
- Put those parts in bold
- Make accomplishments jump off the page

**Why This Works**:
- Hiring managers read these bolded parts first
- They get impressed immediately
- Then they read the rest with a "high performer" lens
- This is powerful psychology

**Example**:
- Regular: "Streamlined supply chain operations by implementing automated inventory management system across 12 warehouse locations, reducing inventory costs by 23% and improving delivery times by 15%"
- With Bold: "Streamlined supply chain operations by implementing automated inventory management system across **12 warehouse locations**, reducing inventory costs by **23%** and improving delivery times by **15%**"

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Impressive parts of bullet points are bolded
- [ ] Key numbers and accomplishments are highlighted
- [ ] Bolding guides the reader's eye to important information

Bold the most impressive parts of your bullet points—especially numbers, percentages, and key accomplishments. This makes your achievements jump off the page and helps hiring managers see your value immediately. They'll read the bolded parts first, get impressed, then read the rest with a positive lens.

### Visual Hierarchy

**What to Do**:
- Use visual hierarchy to guide the reader's eye
- Make key sections stand out
- Use formatting to emphasize important information

**Elements of Visual Hierarchy**:
- Bold job titles
- Clear section headings
- Consistent spacing
- Proper alignment

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Clear visual hierarchy exists
- [ ] Key sections stand out
- [ ] Important information is emphasized
- [ ] Formatting is consistent

Use visual hierarchy to guide the reader's eye. Bold job titles, use clear section headings, maintain consistent spacing, and ensure proper alignment. This makes your resume easy to scan and helps hiring managers find the information they need quickly.
